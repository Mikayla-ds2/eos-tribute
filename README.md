# eos-tribute
My project is a basic webpage tributing the Weeknd's 3rd mixtape called Echoes of Silence (eos). I made my project for the Athean tribute workshop + to improve my web development skills. I made my project using HTML, Javascript, and CSS. I gathered pictures and audio from the internet. I'm deploying my website on Github Pages. There is a navigation bar to go through the 2 other pages of my website. The Tracks Page shares a clip of the songs on his mixtape, in order of my favorite to least favorite. Note: you have to wait until the end of the snippet to continue scrolling as the audios will overlap. The Echo Chamber page is simply a place where people can share their thoughts. I modeled it after the Express Athena website. I struggled a lot with the audio clippings and having them synced to the lyrics and animations. I learned a lot of CSS cursors, embedding audios, and more animations!
